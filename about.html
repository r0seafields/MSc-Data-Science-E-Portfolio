                        Hello! I’m Chantelle, currently studying an MSc in Data Science at the University of Essex Online. 
                        
                        With over a decade of experience in the NHS and broader healthcare sector, I have developed a strong professional foundation in clinical coding, data cleansing/processing and service delivery. My work has consistently intersected with data-driven initiatives, where I’ve cultivated a keen interest in data processing, cleansing, and quality assurance to enhance operational efficiency and support improved patient outcomes. I recognise the transformative potential of well-structured data and the future the profession holds. I am currently pursuing an MSc in Health Informatics to deepen my technical capabilities in areas such as database design, interoperability standards, analytical workflows and programming languages. This academic journey is equipping me with advanced skills in data modelling, validation, and integration; tools that are essential for furthering my career.
