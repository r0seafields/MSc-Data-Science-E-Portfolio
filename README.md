#My MSc Data Science e-Portfolio 

This repository showcases my academic and professional development throughout the Deciphering Big Data module. This module required both collaborative and individual work aligned with the moduleâ€™s learning outcomes, and guided me in growing my technical, analytical and professional skills. 

##Purpose of the e-Portfolio

My e-Portfolio is designed to: 
Demonstrate my understanding of database design, implementation and interoperability in the fictitious healthcare organisation used in my previous assignment. 
Document my skills in collaborative problem solving and working as a team. 
Provide personal reflections on feedback and the learning outcomes. 
Present my Personal Development Plan (PDP) and skills matrix. 

##Structure

The repository is organised into the following sections: 


###Team Exercise Outcomes (covers learning outcomes 2 - 4)
