            <h2><strong>Reflection of Unit 6 and Unit 11 – MedicaidUK’s Database Proposal</strong></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The development of our database design for MedicaidUK started from my initial proposal for a yet unnamed private healthcare organisation. I proposed this design to my peers, who were instrumental in providing their own inputs and amendments to the design to ensure we covered all bases and were as robust as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, the team focused on entity definitions, data types and relational structures, which in turn produced a robust schema and ER diagram that captured the operational complexity of clinical workflows. Building on this foundation, my executive summary elevated this by contextualising our design within the broader landscape of UK healthcare digitisation (with one of the NHS’s top priorities to push this forward), GDPR and other regulatory/legal compliance, and private sector growth. It introduced modelling rationale, compared relational and non-relational architectures, and prioritised the future development of this database model, such as hybrid data ecosystems and predictive analytics. This demonstrated the teams, and my individual, abilities to translate our technical design into a compelling narrative for non-technical minded individuals to understand, that supports MedicaidUK’s strategic objectives and operations.
