            <h2><strong>Reflection of Unit 6 and Unit 11 – MedicaidUK’s Database Proposal</strong></h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The development of our database design for MedicaidUK started from my initial proposal for a yet unnamed private healthcare organisation. I proposed this design to my peers, who were instrumental in providing their own inputs and amendments to the design to ensure we covered all bases and were as robust as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Initially, the team focused on entity definitions, data types and relational structures, which in turn produced a robust schema and ER diagram that captured the operational complexity of clinical workflows. Building on this foundation, my executive summary elevated this by contextualising our design within the broader landscape of UK healthcare digitisation (with one of the NHS’s top priorities to push this forward), GDPR and other regulatory/legal compliance, and private sector growth. It introduced modelling rationale, compared relational and non-relational architectures, and prioritised the future development of this database model, such as hybrid data ecosystems and predictive analytics. This demonstrated the teams, and my individual, abilities to translate our technical design into a compelling narrative for non-technical minded individuals to understand, that supports MedicaidUK’s strategic objectives and operations.

            <h2><strong>End of Module Assessment: Individual Reflection</strong></h2>
        </header>

        <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> I used Gibbs’ Reflective Cycle (1988, cited in The University of Edinburgh, 2025) for this reflection.</p>

        <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
        <p>
            The main project of this module focused on designing a secure, scalable, and regulation-compliant database system for our fictitious private healthcare organisation, MedicaidUK. The aims were to replace the fragmented legacy system currently implemented with a unified MySQL-based solution that manages patient records, appointments, treatments, and billing/insurance workflows. Key aspects of this work included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Entity-Relationship (ER) modelling and normalisation</li>
            <li>Ensuring GDPR, NHS, and other legal compliance</li>
            <li>Providing role-based access control and encryption where necessary</li>
            <li>Evaluating relational vs. non-relational architectures</li>
            <li>Ensuring future scalability via hybrid SQL/NoSQL models</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These components were clearly articulated in both the initial proposal and the executive summary, with technical depth and strategic framing that aligned with MedicaidUK’s transformative goals.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Feelings</strong></h3>
        <p>
            I was excited to use my healthcare experience to contribute to the project and motivated by both useful and ineffective processes I had previously encountered. Initially, I was apprehensive about the technical requirements but became increasingly motivated by collaborative work. I challenged myself to take the lead and draft initial concepts for the group, receiving valuable peer feedback that refined the ER model and logical schema. The experience enhanced my confidence, collaboration, and professional reflection.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Evaluation</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Overall, the experience was highly positive. Our team used Google Docs and Zoom for collaboration, allowing transparency and efficient iteration. My contributions to the ER schema and executive summary were well received, balancing technical rigor and strategic framing. Challenges, such as differing modelling opinions, strengthened my interpersonal and critical thinking skills and reinforced the importance of aligning technical work with stakeholder needs.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3>
        <p>
            This project deepened my understanding of healthcare database architecture, ER modelling, normalization, and SQL/NoSQL evaluation. Exploring MongoDB’s flexibility helped me appreciate hybrid systems and reframed the database design as a dynamic ecosystem. I also learned to write for the audience, ensuring non-technical stakeholders could understand the design and its strategic value.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <p>
            The assignment enhanced my technical and professional skills, particularly in schema design, compliance, and strategic communication. Drafting the executive summary required translating complex design decisions into accessible language. Collaborating with the team increased my confidence, leadership, and reflective abilities, preparing me for future group projects and professional challenges.
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Action Plan</strong></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Consider hybrid modelling strategies in future database design projects, especially for unstructured data.</li>
            <li>Continue refining technical writing for both technical and non-technical audiences.</li>
            <li>Document learning outcomes in my e-Portfolio.</li>
            <li>Engage in peer review and feedback loops to enhance collaborative outcomes and skill development.</li>
        </ul>
